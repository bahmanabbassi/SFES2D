# SFES2D
A 2D spatial &amp; spectral feature extraction &amp; selection tool for geo-imaging (DEMO)

SFES2D harnesses the power of advanced, unsupervised source separation techniques, including principal component analysis (for variance maximization), independent component analysis (for kurtosis and negentropy maximization), continuous wavelet transforms, RGB color processing, and k-means clustering segmentation. These cutting-edge methods enable feature extraction, dimensionality reduction of hyperdimensional geoscientific datasets, and lineament extraction with Bayesian optimization.
