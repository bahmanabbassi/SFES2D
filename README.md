# SFES2D

SFES2D leverages advanced, unsupervised source separation techniques such as principal component analysis (for variance maximization), independent component analysis (for kurtosis and negentropy maximization), continuous wavelet transforms, RGB color processing, and k-means clustering segmentation. These state-of-the-art methods facilitate feature extraction, dimensionality reduction of hyperdimensional geoscientific datasets, and lineament extraction with Bayesian optimization.
